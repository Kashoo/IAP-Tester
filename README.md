This is a simple utility for testing the configuration and behaviour of Apple App Store In-App Purchase products.

To use:

1. In iTunes Connect, create a new product for this app (if not already done).
2. Ensure the corresponding bundle identifier is specified in the Info.plist (if not already done).
3. In iTunes Connect, create and configure any IAP products for test.
4. Enumerate the corresponding IAP identifiers in the ProductIdentifiers.plist.
5. Build and run.
